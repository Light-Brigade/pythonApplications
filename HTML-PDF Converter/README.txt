HTML to PDF Converter
By Zakir Chaudry


To run the application, find the file HtmlToPDF.exe in the folder named 'HtmlToPDF'.


This only works for .HTML/.HTM currently, not .txt or .docx. 

.HTM is the standard file type when you save web pages as complete web pages in Mozilla.
Save web pages in this format by right-clicking and then left-clicking 'Save As'.

Double check the format before loading in the file, but if it is in the wrong format it will alert you.
